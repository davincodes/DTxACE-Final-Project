    "content": "<p>In a rare sit-down interview, the Beatles reflected on the whirlwind of their early fame. Paul McCartney described writing songs in hotel rooms between exhausting tour stops. John Lennon noted how global fame transformed not just their lifestyle but their worldview. The group agreed that their creative chemistry was the secret to their lasting impact.</p><br/><p>George Harrison spoke about their evolution into more experimental sounds, saying it felt like a natural progression. “We were just growing as people,” he explained. Ringo Starr added humor, joking that being a Beatle meant never having a quiet moment. Despite the chaos, they all admitted they would relive it if given the chance.</p><br/><p>When the topic turned to legacy, the tone grew more reflective. “We just made music we loved,” Paul said, his voice soft. John added that they never intended to define a generation — it just happened. Their music, they hoped, would continue to resonate far beyond their time.</p><br/><p>Each member expressed gratitude for the journey and the fans who supported them through it. They acknowledged the challenges of fame but felt the joy far outweighed the struggles. As icons of musical history, they remain humbled by their place in it. And with every note played, their legacy lives on.</p>",
